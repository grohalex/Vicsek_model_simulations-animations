This is a project implementing Vicsek model of collective motion in an animated simulation.

There is not a significant difference between algorithm used in this
project and the method published by Tamas Vicsek et al. in 1995 as ”Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles"
There are five python programs, two of them (basic_animation.py and fancy_animation.py) produce an animated simulation of the system in question while the other files (plots_changing_sigma.py, transition_plot.py
and	visual_inspection.py) create a plots which represent different aspects of the system.

Important property of self-driven particle systems is that they have a state transition, during which we can observe unaligned/chaotic movement changing into a collective motion. For more information please refer to the document "Vicsek_model.pdf" where I explain the algorithm and results in greater detail.
